# MJ Coder

**MJ Coder** is an open-source desktop application for pair programming with AI on your own machine. It ships a complete Agent execution engine — the model can read and write your project files, run shell commands, and call Git and MCP tools to complete coding tasks autonomously under your approval and supervision. All conversations, code, and credentials stay on your computer by default — **offline-first, local-first**.

## Key Features

- **🤖 Complete Agent engine** — tool-calling loop (model → tool execution → results back to model), with automatic large-task decomposition, parallel sub-agents, context compaction, and turn-budget controls
- **🛡️ Three safety gates** — a tiered approval center (dangerous commands / file writes / MCP tools at three levels; dangerous commands are never auto-approved) + macOS Seatbelt OS-level sandbox + hard blocking of dangerous commands on other platforms, with a local audit log for full traceability
- **📁 Project workspaces** — project management, file tree & previews, code diff review panel, Git worktrees for isolation, and one-click PR creation
- **⚙️ Dual-mode models** — connect any OpenAI-compatible endpoint (DeepSeek / Qwen / MiniMax / etc.), freely switch between locally defined and globally shared models; API keys stay in the main process and never reach the renderer
- **⏰ Scheduled tasks** — offline local scheduler; tasks run through the full Agent channel at their due time (with approval, sandbox, and timeout protection)
- **🧩 Plugin ecosystem** — plugin marketplace (MCP servers / skills / prompt packs with signature verification and fail-closed installation), 100 built-in official skills, MCP tool integration
- **🖥️ Computer Use** — drive desktop apps via macOS Accessibility (AX) trees; sensitive actions (payment / delete / send) always require case-by-case confirmation
- **👥 Collaborative editing** — CRDT (Yjs)-based collaboration on conversation threads, task boards, and approval flows; local-first and offline-capable
- **📊 Analytics dashboard** — conversation counts, token consumption, model usage distribution, and activity trends at a glance
- **🎨 Theming** — 5 preset themes plus custom accent colors, with light/dark mode support

## Modules

| Module | Description |
|---|---|
| `desktop/` | Electron desktop app: main process (security / sandbox / tools) + React renderer (UI) + agent-core (headless engine) |
| `server/` | Optional Node.js backend: accounts, cloud task queue, collaboration sync, analytics |
| `miniprogram/` | Optional WeChat mini-program control plane: view tasks, remote approvals (executes no code) |
| `ecosystem/` | Ecosystem assets: 100 skills, 100 MCP connectors, 50 digital-employee definitions |

> Full directory structure and responsibilities are documented under `docs/` (not published with the code).

## Tech Stack

- **Desktop**: Electron 33 · React 18 · Vite · Tailwind CSS
- **Engine**: plain JavaScript (headless Agent engine with zero framework and zero runtime dependencies)
- **Server** (optional): Node.js · Express · PostgreSQL · Yjs
- **Testing**: Node built-in test runner, 35 suites all green

## Quick Start (Offline)

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies (first time)
cd desktop && npm install
cd renderer && npm install && cd ..

# 2. Launch
npm run dev
```

No database, no server, no account required — create a local project and start chatting right away. Configure any OpenAI-compatible model (Base URL + API Key) and you are set; all data is stored locally.

> The server (`server/`) and mini-program (`miniprogram/`) are optional extensions; no deployment is needed for standalone offline use.
